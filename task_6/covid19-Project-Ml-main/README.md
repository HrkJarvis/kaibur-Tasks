# Data Science Example coid19-Project-Ml

# Introduction to the project
As we know that the whole world is affected by the
coronavirus. In this project, we will learn to program a
“Coronavirus Probability Detector” using python and machine
learning concepts. This project is very different yet helpful for
all of us in such a pandemic situation. As this project is about
the programming solution related to the Coronavirus
Outbreak, We will be using Jupyter Notebook for the initial
development and then create UI which tells whether the
person has an infection or not based on input features
using Virtual Studio Code IDE.

# Proposed Idea And Methodology
Stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting
the cases quickly.
 Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19. 
 A machine learning model is then trained on the data to findout the probability of a person having the infection. 
 The model is then used to find out whom to test for theinfection first under a limited testing capacity.
The same model can be used to find potential candidate forconducting random tests.

#  Features
❖ Average Fever-Continous 

❖ Body Pain-0/1 Binary 

❖ Age-Discrete 

❖ Runny Nose 

❖ Breathing Problem- Categorical: 0/1/-1

# IMPLEMENTATION & CODE
❖ First we need to launch the jupyter uCsingO cmd by using  below command
